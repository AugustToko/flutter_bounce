# flutter_bounce

- An efficient flutter package for an **on-tap bounce** animation on any flutter widgets 
- This package is an enhanced version of [bouncing_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/bouncing_widget).
- **Limitation** of the above package: 
    - It is not efficient for the widgets in Scroll Paged. We cannot scroll while having our fingers on the widget
    - The same issue would be found [here](https://github.com/ThomasEcalle/bouncing_widget/issues/1)


## Advantages

- Not sticky on scrolling, efficient bounce effect every where
- With **Duration**, controll the bounce animation
